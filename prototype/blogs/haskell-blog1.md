# ExampleClass Without 'a': A Technical Overview

## Background

This document provides a technical overview of ExampleClass without 'a', a Haskell class definition that allows for the creation of specialized class definitions without a type variable. By omitting the type variable 'a', programmers can create more specialized class definitions that can improve code clarity and performance.

## Syntax

The syntax for ExampleClass without 'a' is similar to that of a regular Haskell class definition, except that the type variable 'a' is omitted. Here is an example:

    class ExampleClassWithoutA where
        exampleFunction :: Int -> Int

## Usage

ExampleClass without 'a' can be useful in situations where polymorphic functions are not needed, or where a more specialized class definition is desired. However, it should be used with caution, as it may limit the flexibility of the resulting code.

## Conclusion

ExampleClass without 'a' provides a specialized class definition option in Haskell, but should be used judiciously. By understanding the syntax and usage of this class, Haskell programmers can improve their code's clarity and performance.
