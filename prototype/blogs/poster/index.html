        <p>Patio is an international community of worker cooperatives worldwide, focused on digital technology, communication, and design development. We provide a supportive and collaborative network of like-minded cooperatives dedicated to social responsibility, democratic decision-making, and an alternative to corporate capitalism. As a member of Patio, you can access numerous benefits, including shared resources, opportunities for peer learning, and a platform to showcase your cooperative's work. We collaborate through knowledge-sharing, job opportunities, and shared human resources. Patio delivers an optimal experience for both co-op members and our partners.</p>
