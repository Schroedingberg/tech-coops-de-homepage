        <p style="--line-number: 1;">Patio is a global community of worker-owned cooperatives from all over the world, specializing in the
            development of digital technology, communication, and design. Our federation offers a supportive and
            collaborative network of like-minded cooperatives committed to social responsibility, democratic
            decision-making, and a new world beyond corporate capitalism. As a Patio member, you will have access to a
            variety of benefits, including shared resources, peer-to-peer learning opportunities, and a platform to
            showcase your cooperative's work. We collaborate by sharing knowledge, job opportunities, and human
            resources. Patio provides the best experience for both co-op members and our partners.</p>

            <p style="--line-number: 2;">Our organization is divided into four small circles, and each one has its own tasks and goals to
                accomplish. Once every two weeks, we all get together to share what every circle has
                been working on and
                make different kinds of decisions about our community.</p>
