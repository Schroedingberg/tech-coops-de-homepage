Let A and B be two objects in a category C. A binary product of A and B is an object P in C equipped with two projection morphisms `π₁ : P → A` and `π₂ : P → B` such that for any object X in C and morphisms `f : X → A` and `g : X → B`, there exists a unique morphism `h : X → P` such that `f = π₁ ∘ h` and `g = π₂ ∘ h`.

We will show that this definition satisfies the two requirements of a universal property: existence and uniqueness.

Point 1: Existence - There exists an object P in C equipped with projection morphisms π₁ and π₂ that satisfy the above property.

Proof: We can construct an object P in C equipped with projection morphisms `π₁ : P → A` and `π₂ : P → B` as follows. Let `P = A × B` be the product of A and B in C. Then, by definition, `P` comes equipped with two projection morphisms `π₁ : P → A` and `π₂ : P → B`. We claim that `P` satisfies the above property.

To see this, suppose we have an object `X` in `C` and morphisms `f : X → A` and `g : X → B`. By the universal property of the product, there exists a unique morphism `h : X → A × B` such that `f = π₁ ∘ h` and `g = π₂ ∘ h`. It follows that `h` satisfies the property described above.

Point 2: Uniqueness - Any other object P' in C equipped with projection morphisms `π'₁ : P' → A` and `π'₂ : P' → B` that satisfy the above property is isomorphic to P.

Proof: Suppose that `P'` is another object in `C` equipped with projection morphisms `π'₁ : P' → A` and `π'₂ : P' → B` that satisfy the property described above. We need to show that `P` is isomorphic to `P'`.

Consider the morphisms `f : A → P'` and `g : B → P'` defined as follows: `f = π'₁ ∘ h` and `g = π'₂ ∘ h`, where `h` is the unique morphism from `A × B` to `P'` that satisfies `π'₁ ∘ h = π₁` and `π'₂ ∘ h = π₂`. To show that `P` is isomorphic to `P'`, we will construct an isomorphism between `P` and `P'`.

Define the morphism `φ : P → P'` as follows: `φ(p) = f(p₁) ∘ g(p₂)`, where `p = (p₁, p₂)`. We claim that `φ` is an isomorphism.

First, we will show that `φ` is well-defined. Suppose we have `p = (p₁, p₂)` and `p' = (p'₁, p'₂)` in `P` such that `p = p'`. Then, we have `p₁ = p'₁` and `p₂ = p'₂`. It follows that `f(p₁) ∘ g(p₂) = f(p'₁) ∘ g(p'₂)`. Hence, `φ

is well-defined.

Next, we will show that φ is an isomorphism.

To see this, we will construct an inverse morphism ψ : P' → P. Define ψ(q) = (π₁(q), π₂(q)) for any q in P'. We claim that ψ is the inverse of φ.

First, we will show that φ ∘ ψ = id_{P'}, where id_{P'} is the identity morphism on P'. For any q in P', we have:

(φ ∘ ψ)(q) = φ(ψ(q))
            = f(π₁(q)) ∘ g(π₂(q))
            = π'₁(q) ∘ π'₂(q)
            = id_{P'}(q)
Hence, φ ∘ ψ = id_{P'}.

Next, we will show that ψ ∘ φ = id_P, where id_P is the identity morphism on P. For any p in P, we have:

(ψ ∘ φ)(p) = ψ(φ(p))
            = (π₁(f(p₁) ∘ g(p₂)), π₂(f(p₁) ∘ g(p₂)))
            = (p₁, p₂)
            = id_P(p)
Hence, ψ ∘ φ = id_P.

Therefore, φ is an isomorphism, and P is isomorphic to P'. This completes the proof of uniqueness.

Therefore, the proposed definition of a binary product in a category satisfies the two requirements of a universal property: existence and uniqueness.
