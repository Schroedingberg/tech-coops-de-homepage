# Homomorphisms

Homomorphisms are a specific type of morphism in category theory that preserve the group
structure. In the category of groups, all morphisms between objects are homomorphisms,
since they must preserve the group structure.

## Etymology

The term "homomorphism" comes from the Greek words "homo" meaning "same" and "morphism"
meaning "shape" or "form." The idea is that a homomorphism preserves the shape or
structure of the group, even though the elements themselves may change.

## Example

For example, consider the groups (Z, +) and (Z > 0, *), where A = (Z, +) and B = (Z > 0, *).
We can define a homomorphism f from A to B as follows: f(x) = 2^x for all x in Z. This
homomorphism preserves the group structure of A and B, since f(x + y) = f(x) * f(y) for
all x,y in Z.

## Hom-sets

In the category of groups, Hom(A,B) refers to the set of all morphisms from A to B. However,
it's important to note that not all morphisms between A and B necessarily preserve the
group structure, and not all morphisms in Hom(A,B) are homomorphisms. The set Hom(A,B)
includes all morphisms from A to B, whether they preserve the structure or not.

The confusion between homomorphisms and Hom-sets can be frustrating, especially for those
new to category theory. However, with clear definitions and careful use of language, it is
possible to navigate these concepts and use them effectively in mathematical discussions.
