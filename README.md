### Contents

`prototype/` contains a straight HTML/CSS/etc. version of the prototype
page. The static site generation system (to be added later) should produce
essentially the same output under the `output/` directory.

### Developers

For development help contact `@cjs_tng_jp` or `@yasu_tng_jp` on Patio
Mattermost chat, or anybody else in the `#homepage-technical` channel.
Design and content is done by the folks in the `#Community Landing Page`
group.
