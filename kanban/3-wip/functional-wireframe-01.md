BTW, I'd probably stick this in a `TODO.md` file in the repo; that has the
advantage in keeping the info in "our" information, rather than a separate
GitHub proprietary database that doesn't travel with the repo. That said,
I'm not too fussed about this.

And, "atomic commits, so that each step of the process can be understood
coherently," yes! If the commits tell a story as you read through them that
is a fantastic aid to communication amongst developers!

In response to excellent suggestion, created kanban folder, with subdirs:

    kanban folder │ purpose
    ──────────────┼───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    1-new         │ new "creative" suggestions of all kinds and priorities
    2-todo        │ prioritized backlog
    3-wip         │ what we're working on right now, kept to a minimum
    4-mvp01       │ tasks completed for current mvp

All folders to be populated with `.md` files, which can be moved to
different folders according to their kanban state. We'll keep this as
simple as possible.

Great, no more github issues, which can be downloaded via the Github API,
but are not accessible via repo, like the Github Wiki (which we'll only use
if necessary)

And we will place references in the `TODO.md` files to actual commits as
the tasks are completed, and/or otherwise acted upon.
